The method of  claim 1 , wherein the activating step is in response to detection of audio by the detecting step. \\n     \\n     \\n       5. The method of  claim 1 , wherein the displaying by each VCC IHS respective video images of the users step comprises displaying a first color indicator that designates one user video image as a speaker participant and a second color indicator that designates another user video image as a target participant. \\n     \\n     \\n       6. The method of  claim 1 , wherein the displaying by each VCC IHS respective video images of the users step comprises displaying an arrow from a speaker participant video image to a target participant video image to distinguish the speaker participant video image from the target participant video image. \\n     \\n     \\n       7. The method of  claim 1 , wherein the displaying by each VCC IHS respective video images of the users step comprises displaying a text message to distinguish the speaker participant video image from the target participant video image. \\n     \\n     \\n       8. The method of  claim 1 , wherein the displaying by each VCC IHS respective video images of the users step comprises displaying first and second icons associated with the speaker participant video image and the target participant video image, respectively, to distinguish the speaker participant video image from the target participant video image. \\n     \\n     \\n       9. A communication method for a video chat capable (VCC) information handling system (IHS), comprising:\\n receiving, by a particular VCC IHS, a plurality of user video images from other VCC IHSs in a video chat session, thus providing received user video images; \\n displaying, by the particular VCC IHS, the received user video images on a display of the particular VCC IHS, the particular VCC IHS also displaying a user video image of the user of the particular IHS; \\n detecting, by the particular VCC IHS, audio from the user of the particular VCC IHS, thus designating a speaker participant; \\n determining, by a gaze direction detector in the particular VCC IHS, the particular user video image at which the speaker participant is currently gazing on the display, thus designating a target participant, other users being designated as passive participants; and \\n transmitting, by the particular VCC IHS, speaker participant identification (ID) information and target participant identification (ID) information for use by other VCC IHSs in the video chat session; \\n displaying, by a display of the particular VCC IHS, the user video image of the target participant at which the speaker participant is gazing as determined by the gaze direction detector, the particular display also displaying the user video image of the speaker participant and user video images of passive participants, wherein the display of the particular VCC IHS displays a speaking participant indicator to visually indicate the speaking participant and a target participant indicator to visually indicate the target participant as determined by the gaze of the speaking participant; \\n receiving, by another VCC IHS, the speaker participant (ID) information and target participant (ID) information; \\n displaying, by a display of the another VCC IHS, the speaking participant indicator in response to receiving the speaker participant (ID) information to indicate the speaking participant to a user of the another VCC IHS, and that displays the target participant indicator in response to the receiving the target ID \\n \\n       information to indicate the target participant to the user of the another IHS as determined by the gaze of the speaking participant, the another display further displaying other user video images as passive participants. \\n     \\n     \\n       10. The method of  claim 9 , wherein the transmitting speaker participant ID information and target participant ID information step comprises transmitting, by the particular VCC IHS, speaker participant identification (ID) information and target participant identification (ID) information to a server IHS that includes a gaze aware video chat manager. \\n     \\n     \\n       11.
