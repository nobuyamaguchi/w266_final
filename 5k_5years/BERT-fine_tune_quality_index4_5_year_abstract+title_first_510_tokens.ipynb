A method of retrofitting an orifice meter includes providing an orifice fitting body having a bore, an orifice plate, a plurality of tap holes, and a plurality of pressure sensors installed in the plurality of tap holes. The method further includes removing the orifice plate and the plurality of pressure sensors from the orifice fitting body and installing a plurality of transducers into the plurality of tap holes. At least one of the plurality of transducers is configured to generate a signal and at least one of the plurality of transducers is configured to receive the signal. Additionally, the method includes measuring a flow rate of a fluid flowing through the bore based on an output of each of the plurality of transducers.   \n",
