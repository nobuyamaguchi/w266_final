The computer system can include a basis module configured to define at the shadow system a shadow basis database related to start functionality of the shadow system. The computer system can also include a downtime execution module configured to trigger the shadow system to change from a downstate to an upstate based on a combination of data included in the shadow basis database and the data of the shadow program database.  \n",
